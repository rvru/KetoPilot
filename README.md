# KetoPilot 🚀

A sophisticated Flutter application for metabolic health optimization, focused on gram-centric macro tracking and biomarker monitoring for ketogenic therapy.

## 📱 Features

### Core Functionality
- **Gram-Centric Tracking**: Focus on grams rather than calories for precise macro management
- **Smart Goal System**: Different approaches for carbs (limits) vs protein/fat (goals)
- **Biomarker Monitoring**: Track glucose, BHB (ketones), and GKI (Glucose Ketone Index)
- **Real-time Health Status**: Color-coded indicators for optimal, good, and high ranges
- **Animated Progress Bars**: Beautiful visual feedback for daily nutrition progress

### UI/UX Excellence
- **Professional Medical Theme**: Clean, medical-grade green color scheme
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for all screen sizes from iPhone SE to iPad Pro
- **MacroFactor-Inspired Design**: Clean bottom navigation with floating action button
- **Swipeable Views**: Swipe between Daily and Weekly views for both Nutrition and Biomarkers
- **Smooth Animations**: Polished micro-interactions throughout the app

### Dashboard Features
- **Daily & Weekly Nutrition**: Swipe between daily macro bars and weekly nutrition trends
- **Daily & Weekly Biomarkers**: Toggle between current readings and weekly biomarker patterns
- **GKI Circle Display**: Prominent glucose-ketone index with color-coded health status
- **Quick Actions Grid**: Fast access to logging, food diary, health tracking, and analytics
- **Health Metrics Overview**: Weight, heart rate, and other key indicators
- **Recent Readings**: Timeline of recent glucose and ketone measurements
